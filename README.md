## API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow the steps below to get your API key:

1. Visit the [OpenWeatherMap API website](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Once logged in, navigate to the "API keys" section to generate a new API key.
4. Copy the generated API key.

### Configuration

Since the `key.js` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file, you need to manually create the file. Follow these steps:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `key.js`.
2. Open `key.js` in a text editor.
3. Paste the following code into `key.js`:

export const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```
